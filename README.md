# Explainable_AI with SHAP Values

 - Explainable AI (XAI) is a subfield of AI that solely focuses on creating models that are transparent and understandable to humans.

 - Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) is a framework for Explainable AI and it provides a way to explain why and how a model makes a certain prediction, by calculating the contribution of of each feature to the prediction through the help of <b>Game Theory</b> Concepts.

Throught this project we are exploring the most important features that have contribution in making predictions.
